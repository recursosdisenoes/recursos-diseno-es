## Las 10 heurísticas de Nielsen
### 1. Visibilidad de estado del sistema
The design should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time.

When users know the current system status, they learn the outcome of their prior interactions and determine next steps. Predictable interactions create trust in the product as well as the brand.

#### Ejemplo
_**Example of Usability Heuristic #1:** “You Are Here” indicators on mall maps have to show people where they currently are, to help them understand where to go next._

#### Cómo aplicarla
- Communicate clearly to users what the system’s state is — no action with consequences to users should be taken without informing them.
- Present feedback to the user as quickly as possible (ideally, immediately).
- Build trust through open and [continuous communication](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/microinteractions/).


### 2. Sistema <-> mundo real
The design should speak the users' language. Use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.

The way you should design depends very much on your specific users. Terms, concepts, icons, and images that seem perfectly clear to you and your colleagues may be unfamiliar or confusing to your users.

When a design’s controls follow real-world conventions and correspond to desired outcomes (called [natural mapping](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/natural-mappings/)), it’s easier for users to learn and remember how the interface works. This helps to build an experience that feels intuitive.

#### Ejemplo
_**Example of Usability Heuristic #2:** When stovetop controls match the layout of heating elements, users can quickly understand which control maps to which heating element._

#### Tips
- Ensure users can understand meaning without having to go look up a word’s definition.
- Never assume your understanding of words or concepts will match those of your users.
- User research will help you uncover your [users' familiar terminology,](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-centric-language/) as well as their mental models around important concepts.


### 3. Control del usuario y libertad
Users often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted action without having to go through an extended process.

When it's easy for people to back out of a process or undo an action, it fosters a sense of freedom and confidence. Exits allow users to remain in control of the system and avoid getting stuck and feeling frustrated.

#### Ejemplo
_**Example of Usability Heuristic #3:** Digital spaces need quick “emergency exits,” just like physical spaces do._

#### Cómo aplicarla
-   Support _Undo_ and _Redo_.
-   Show a clear way to exit the current interaction, like a *[Cancel* button](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/reset-and-cancel-buttons/).
-   Make sure the exit is clearly labeled and discoverable.


### 4. Consistencia y estándares
Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform and industry conventions.

[Jakob's Law](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/jakobs-law-internet-ux/) states that people spend most of their time using digital products _other than yours_. Users’ experiences with those other products set their expectations. Failing to maintain consistency may increase the users'[cognitive load](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/minimize-cognitive-load/) by forcing them to learn something new.

#### Ejemplo
_Check-in counters are usually located at the front of hotels. This consistency meets customers’ expectations._

#### Cómo aplicarla
-   Improve [learnability](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/learnability-efficiency-ui-design/) by maintaining both types of consistency: internal and external.
-   Maintain [consistency](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/omnichannel-consistency/) within a single product or a [family of products (internal consistency).](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/design-systems/)
-   Follow established [industry conventions](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/do-interface-standards-stifle-design-creativity/) (external consistency).


### 5. Prevención de errores
Good error messages are important, but the best designs carefully prevent problems from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions, or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.

There are two types of errors: [slips and mistakes](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/slips-vs-mistakes/). Slips are unconscious errors caused by inattention. Mistakes are conscious errors based on a mismatch between the user’s mental model and the design.

#### Ejemplo
_Guard rails on curvy mountain roads prevent drivers from falling off cliffs._

#### Cómo aplicarla
-   Prioritize your effort: Prevent high-cost errors first, then little frustrations.
-   [Avoid slips](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/slips/) by providing helpful constraints and good [defaults](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-power-of-defaults/).
-   Prevent mistakes by removing memory burdens, supporting undo, and [warning your users](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/confirmation-dialog/).
