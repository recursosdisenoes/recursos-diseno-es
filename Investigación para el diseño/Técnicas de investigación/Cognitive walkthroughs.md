## Qué es
[[Investigación evaluativa]]

Cognitive walkthroughs are used to examine the [usability](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/usability "What is Usability?") of a product. They are designed to see whether or not a new user can easily carry out tasks within a given system. It is a task-specific approach to usability (in contrast to [[Evaluación heurística]] which is a more holistic usability inspection). 

The idea is that if given a choice – most users prefer to do things to learn a product rather than to read a manual or follow a set of instructions.

## Ventajas
- Coste-efectivo
- It can also be implemented prior to development during the design phase which can give rapid insight before budget is spent developing an unusable product.

## How to Conduct a Cognitive Walkthrough
A cognitive walkthrough begins by defining the task or tasks that the user would be expected to carry out. It is these tasks that the cognitive walkthrough will examine for usability – any tasks that can be performed in the product but are not subject to a cognitive walkthrough will not, normally, be assessed during the process.

First, CWW uses realistic narrative descriptions of user goals that incorporate rich information about users’ understanding of their tasks and underlying motivation. Second, CWW assumes that generating an action on a webpage (e.g., clicking a link, button, or other widget) is a two-step process. Step one is an attention process that parses a webpage into subregions and attends to the subregion of the page that is  
semantically most similar to the user goal. Step two is an action selection process that selects and acts on a widget from the attended-to subregion, the widget semantically most similar to the user goal. This two-step CWW web navigation mechanism is derived from a theory of the cognitive processes that control goal driven exploration, CoLiDeS (Kitajima et al., 2000).

### Preguntas
-   Will the user try and achieve the right outcome?
-   Will the user notice that the correct action is available to them?
-   Will the user associate the correct action with the outcome they expect to achieve?
-   If the correct action is performed; will the user see that progress is being made towards their intended outcome?

### Will the user try and achieve the right outcome?
This question is trying to examine whether the interface is making [assumptions](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/assumptions "What is Assumptions?") about a user’s level of experience or knowledge that aren’t accurate. It can also help identify when a user’s expectations of an action don’t align with the actual action taken because they are using other reference points and becoming confused (for example, the use of language in your product is in common usage in other products and means something else).

For example; let’s say you have invented a new gun. Your gun is fired by pushing a button on the side and the traditional trigger mechanism is used to chamber a round before firing. It is unlikely that your gun will be a success because in all other guns – a trigger is used to fire a round. The user is likely to pull the trigger and be disappointed by the outcome.

### Will the user notice that the correct action is available to them?
Hidden or obscured controls are a problem for users. The more data that you present and the more choice that you present; the less likely it is that a user will know what to do. If you bury a control in a menu system rather than having it present while an action is taking place, the same is true; your users won’t know what to do.

One of the most common examples of this in real life is the TV or DVD remote control. These provide an overwhelming number of options to users and are often confusing to use. In many cases manufacturers try to tackle this by placing rarely used functions underneath a sliding cover; by reducing options the control is easier to use.

### Will the user associate the correct action with the outcome they expect to achieve?
If your use of language is poor, for example you use overly complex words or industry jargon, it can be hard for a user to work out what is needed to achieve their outcome. This is also true when you use complex actions (think Ctrl+Alt+Del – it may be something you’re intimately familiar with now – if you use Windows – but it’s not exactly intuitive is it?) to carry out an action.

Steve Krug, says in his book “Don’t Make me Think” – “It doesn’t matter how many times I have to click, as long as each click is a mindless, unambiguous choice.”

### If the correct action is performed; will the user see that progress is being made towards their intended outcome?
This will help you investigate when feedback in the system is missing, badly worded, easy to miss or plain old ambiguous. You need to let your users know about the progress they are making in the task. It’s why computer games use loading screens to signify moving on to the next level and why it’s always a good idea to have a “thank you” note when a customer finishes making an order.
