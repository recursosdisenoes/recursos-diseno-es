## Qué es
[A/B testing](https://vwo.com/ab-testing/) determines if a given change positively or negatively impacts a site’s performance. Testing involves using a control page (page without the change) and a variant page (page with the change). A/B testing software, such as [Convert](https://www.convert.com/) or [AB Tasty](https://www.abtasty.com/), then splits traffic evenly between the two and tracks the conversion rate for the control and the variant. 

An A/B test can be concluded and implemented once it reaches **statistical significance**.

## Statistical significance
**Statistical significance** proves the level of certainty that the results of a given test are not due to a sampling error. Statistical significance is used across many different industries and testing environments, including:

-   Academic research,
-   psychology tests,
-   medical tests,
-   and many more.

Within the realm of A/B testing these data sets are typically the number of users and number of conversions for each variation. Using statistical significance proves that an A/B test was successful or unsuccessful. Ideally, all A/B test reach 95% statistical significance, or 90% at the very least. 

Reaching above 90% ensures that the change will either negatively or positively impact a site’s performance. The best way to reach statistical significance is to test pages with a high amount of traffic or a high conversion rate. The ideal test length falls anywhere between 2 and 8 weeks. However, sometimes a test will **never** reach statistical significance due to low traffic or low conversion volume.

We recommend running most tests for a maximum of 2 months due to cookies being reset or deleted. You don’t want users included in multiple versions of a test while it’s running because that will skew the data. If a test isn’t reaching statistical significance conclude the test and consider making a more drastic change or moving the test to an area of your site with higher traffic or a higher conversion rate.
