# UI para TV

### Color[](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/fire-tv/design-and-user-experience-guidelines.html#color)
Television screens have a higher contrast than computer screens, which can make colors seem more saturated, brighter, and vibrant. The color gamut (the range of colors that can be displayed) is also less than that of a PC screen. In your app, use less saturated colors. Cool colors (blue, purple, gray) work better than warmer colors (red, orange).
