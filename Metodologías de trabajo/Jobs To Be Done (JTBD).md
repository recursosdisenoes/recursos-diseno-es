## Qué es
[Personas](https://www.nngroup.com/courses/personas/) have long been a useful tool in a [[Diseño centrado en los humanos o diseño centrado en los usuarios]] process; however, in recent years, **jobs-to-be done**, a new technique for focusing on customer needs, has been gaining steady prominence.

Definition: **Jobs-to-be-done (JTBD)** is a framework based on the idea that whenever users “hire” (i.e., use) a product, they do it for a specific “job” (i.e., to achieve a particular outcome). The set of “jobs” for the product amounts to a comprehensive list of user needs.

>With the popularity of the JTBD paradigm, there are calls in some corners to abandon personas, suggesting that JTBD has emerged as a more useful technique. This point of view is based on a **fundamental misunderstanding** of the purpose of personas as primarily demographic representations of users, missing the key behavioral considerations that are essential to good personas and that provide much needed guidance for interaction design and product strategy.

While the JTBD framework is *new*, it is similar in many ways to established methods such as [[task analysis]] and [[use cases]], which focus on the context, goals, and steps involved in the interaction with a product. 
The core differentiator between JTBD and these traditional system-analysis techniques is that **JTBD is much less prescriptive about what exactly the users’ task is, and how they will accomplish it**. 

Task analysis and use cases aim to understand the best way in which the product can handle the typical activities that users need to do (and often end up being biased by existing solutions); the JTBD approach moves the focus on **desired outcomes and questions** whether those typical activities are the way of reaching the outcomes that users really seek.
