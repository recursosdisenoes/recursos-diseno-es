### Qué son

Ben Shneiderman (born August 21, 1947) is an American computer scientist and professor at the University of Maryland Human-Computer Interaction Lab. His work is comparable to other contemporary design thinkers like [Don Norman](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/don-norman) and Jakob Nielsen. In his popular book "Designing the User Interface: Strategies for Effective Human-Computer Interaction", Shneiderman reveals his eight golden rules of interface design.

### Para qué sirven

Follow Ben Shneiderman’s 'Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design' if you want to design great, productive and frustration-free user interfaces. Apple, Google and Microsoft are among some of the highly successful companies whose well-designed products reflect Shneiderman’s rules. The characteristics derived from Shneiderman’s golden rules can be recognized in various [user interface](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ui-design) guidelines produced by corporate giants like the companies mentioned above. The visual embodiment of these rules is even more evident in the resulting popular interfaces they produce. This article will teach you to improve your work by integrating the 8 golden rules.

### Las 8 reglas

#### 1. Busca la consistencia

by utilizing familiar icons, colors, menu hierarchy, call-to-actions, and [user flows](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-flows) when designing similar situations and sequence of actions. Standardizing the way information is conveyed ensures users are able to apply knowledge from one click to another; without the need to learn new representations for the same actions. Consistency plays an important role by helping users become familiar with the digital landscape of your product so they can achieve their goals more easily.

&#x20;**Ejemplo**

“Consistency” and “Perceived Stability” are woven into the design of Apple’s Mac OS. The Mac OS Menu Bar is designed to contain consistent graphic elements regardless of whether it’s a version from the 1980’s or the 2010’s.

#### 2. Permite que los usuarios frecuentes tomen atajos

With increased use comes the demand for quicker methods of completing tasks. For example, both Windows and Mac provide users with keyboard shortcuts for copying and pasting, so as the user becomes more experienced, they can navigate and operate the user interface more quickly and effortlessly.

&#x20;**Ejemplo**

As mentioned previously, Mac allows users to use a variety of keyboard shortcuts, commonly used examples include copy and paste (Command-C and Command-V), and taking screenshots (Command-Shift-3).

_Mac allow users to forgo mouse-clicks by providing them with keyboard shortcuts._

#### 3. Ofrece _feedback_ informativo

The user should know where they are at and what is going on at all times. For every action there should be appropriate, human-readable feedback within a reasonable amount of time. A good example of applying this would be to indicate to the user where they are at in the process when working through a multi-page questionnaire. A bad example we often see is when an error message shows an error-code instead of a human-readable and meaningful message.

```

_The Windows Media Player designers should have remembered Ben Shneiderman’s 3rd golden rule: Offer informative feedback. Poorly designed error messages often show an error-code that does not mean anything to the user. As a good designer you should always seek to give human-readable and meaningful feedback._

&#x20;**Ejemplo**

A great example of visual feedback can be seen when a file becomes “highlighted” as the user clicks on a file on a Mac desktop. Another example is when the user drags a folder across the desktop, they can see the folder represented as physically being moved as they hold down their mouse.

#### 4. Diseña diálogos para proveer cierre

Don’t keep your users guessing. Tell them what their action has led them to. For example, users would appreciate a “Thank You” message and a proof of purchase receipt when they’ve completed an online purchase.

&#x20;**Ejemplo**

#### 5. Ofrece una sencilla gestión de errores

No one likes to be told they’re wrong, especially your users. Systems should be designed to be as fool-proof as possible, but when unavoidable errors occur, ensure users are provided with simple, intuitive step-by-step instructions to solve the problem as quickly and painlessly as possible. For example, flag the text fields where the users forgot to provide input in an online form.

&#x20;**Ejemplo**

#### 6. Permite revertir acciones fácilmente

Designers should aim to offer users obvious ways to reverse their actions. These reversals should be permitted at various points whether it occurs after a single action, a [data entry](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/data-entry) or a whole sequence of actions. As Shneiderman states in his book:

```
> This feature relieves anxiety, since the user knows that errors can be undone; it thus encourages exploration of unfamiliar options.
```

&#x20;**Ejemplo**

#### 7. Apoya su sensación de control

Allow your users to be the initiators of actions. Give users the sense that they are in full control of events occurring in the digital space. Earn their trust as you design the system to behave as they expect.

&#x20;**Ejemplo**

#### 8. Reduce la carga de su memoria a corto plazo

Human attention is limited and we are only capable of maintaining around five items in our short-term memory at one time. Therefore, interfaces should be as simple as possible with proper information hierarchy, and choosing recognition over recall. Recognizing something is always easier than recall because recognition involves perceiving cues that help us reach into our vast memory and allowing relevant information to surface. For example, we often find the format of multiple choice questions easier than short answer questions on a [test](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/test) because it only requires us to recognize the answer rather than recall it from our memory. Jakob Nielsen, a user advocate who’s been called one of the “world’s most influential designers” by Bloomberg Businessweek has invented several [usability](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/usability) methods including [heuristic evaluation](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/heuristic-evaluation). Recognition over recall is one of Nielsen’s ten usability [heuristics](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/heuristics) for interface design.
