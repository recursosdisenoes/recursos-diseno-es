## Qué es
**Business Model Canvas**, traducido como **lienzo de modelo de negocio**, es una plantilla de gestión estratégica para el desarrollo de nuevos modelos de negocio o documentar los ya existentes. Es un [gráfico](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%A1fica "Gráfica") visual con elementos que describen propuestas de producto o de valor de la empresa, la infraestructura, los clientes y las finanzas. Ayuda a las empresas a alinear sus actividades mediante la ilustración de posibles compensaciones.

## Origen
El modelo de negocio del lienzo fue propuesto inicialmente por [Alexander Osterwalder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Osterwalder "en:Alexander Osterwalder")[[1]](about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fes.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FLienzo_de_modelo_de_negocio#cite_note-innovacion.cl-1)​ sobre la base de su anterior trabajo sobre la ontología de los modelos de negocio. Desde la publicación de la obra de Osterwalder en 2009, han aparecido nuevos lienzos para nichos específicos, como el Lienzo Lean.

## Estructura
Infraestructura

	Partners
Oferta
	Value prop
		Quantitative – price and efficiency
		Qualitative – overall customer experience and outcome
Customers
	Segments
		Mass market: There is no specific segmentation for a company that follows the mass market element as the organization displays a wide view of potential clients: e.g. car.
		Niche market: Customer segmentation based on specialized needs and characteristics of its clients: e.g. Rolex.
		Segmented: A company applies additional segmentation within existing customer segment. In the segmented situation, the business may further distinguish its clients based on gender, age, and/or income.
		Diversify: A business serves multiple customer segments with different needs and characteristics.
		Multi-sided platform/market: For a smooth day-to-day business operation, some companies will serve mutually dependent customer segments. A credit card company will provide services to credit card holders while simultaneously assisting merchants who accept those credit cards.
Canales
Relación con clientes
	Personal assistance: Assistance in a form of employee-customer interaction. Such assistance is performed during sales and/or after sales.
	Dedicated personal assistance: The most intimate and hands-on personal assistance in which a sales representative is assigned to handle all the needs and questions of a special set of clients.
	Self service: The type of relationship that translates from the indirect interaction between the company and the clients. Here, an organization provides the tools needed for the customers to serve themselves easily and effectively.
	Automated services: A system similar to self-service but more personalized as it has the ability to identify individual customers and their preferences. An example of this would be Amazon.com making book suggestions based on the characteristics of previous book purchases.
	Communities: Creating a community allows for direct interactions among different clients and the company. The community platform produces a scenario where knowledge can be shared and problems are solved between different clients.
	Co-creation: A personal relationship is created through the customer's direct input to the final outcome of the company's products/services.
Finanzas
	Estructura de costes
		Tipos
			Cost-driven: This business model focuses on minimizing all costs and having no frills: e.g. low-cost airlines.
			Value driven: Less concerned with cost, this business model focuses on creating value for products and services: e.g. Louis Vuitton, Rolex.
		Características
			Fixed costs – Costs are unchanged across different applications: e.g. salary, rent.
			Variable costs – Costs vary depending on the amount of production of goods or services: e.g. music festivals.
			Economies of scale – Costs go down as the amount of goods are ordered or produced.
			Economies of scope – Costs go down due to incorporating other businesses which have a direct relation to the original product.
	Revenue streams
		Asset sale – (the most common type) Selling ownership rights to a physical good: e.g. retail corporations.
		Usage fee – Money generated from the use of a particular service: e.g. UPS.
		Subscription fees – Revenue generated by selling access to a continuous service: e.g. Netflix.
		Lending/leasing/renting – Giving exclusive right to an asset for a particular period of time: e.g. leasing a car.
		Licensing – Revenue generated from charging for the use of a protected intellectual property.
		Brokerage fees – Revenue generated from an intermediate service between 2 parties: e.g. broker selling a house for commission.
		Advertising – Revenue generated from charging fees for product advertising
