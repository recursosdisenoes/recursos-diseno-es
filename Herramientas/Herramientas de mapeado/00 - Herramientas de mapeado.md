## Three-Step Decision Framework
Before beginning any mapping effort (regardless of the type), 3 decisions must be made:

### **1. Current (as-is) vs. future (to-be)**
This decision involves the actions and states depicted in the visualization: do they reflect the current state of the world or a desired state of the world?

-   Current mappings are based on an actual “today” state of what you are mapping. This approach is ideal when the mapping goal is to identify and document existing problems and pain points. Use current state maps to help analyze research or align a team around a data validated problem.
-   Future mappings are based on an “ideal” state for a user type, experience, or a to-be service structure. Future state maps help reinvent and conceive how a user or experience would feel in the future. Use future state maps to set a benchmark or goal for the ideal form of your product or service.

### **2. Hypothesis vs. research**
This decision depends on the type of input that you will use to build your mapping.

-   Hypothesis mappings are based on an accumulation of existing understanding within a team or organization. This approach is a great way to merge multiple existing team views, create a research plan (based on the gaps that emerge from your hypothesis map), and make a first step towards a higher-fidelity, research-based map.
-   Research mapping is based on data gathered specifically for building the map. This approach is best when there are time and resources dedicated to creating a research plan. While this method creates the best maps, it takes time and significant buy-in. Regardless of where you start, your maps should be iterative and constantly updated with new findings.

### **3. Low-fidelity vs. high-fidelity**
This decision pertains to the quality of the final map visualization.

-   Low-fidelity maps are unpolished and often created with [sticky notes](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/post-it-in-ux/) in a flexible, unrefined manner. These maps are best in an early part of the process. Low fidelity means little commitment or creation effort and empowers people to collaborate, revise, and update as needed. Use sticky notes (physically on the wall or digitally with tools like Mural.co) or collaborative excel sheets.
-   High-fidelity maps are polished, created digitally, and look final. High fidelity maps are the best for creating an artifact that is going to be shared amongst many. High fidelity can be easier to read, but less flexible because of the “finished” nature of the product. These maps are often created digitally, then dispersed.
