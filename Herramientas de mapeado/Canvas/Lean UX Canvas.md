## Qué es
It’s a facilitation tool for cross-functional teams designed to create a **customer-centric conversation** about the work the team is doing. The goal was to help the team focus on “why” they’re doing the current work.

It provides an **initial recipe** for teams to follow in the early stages of [[Agile]] adoption. It’s a kind of “insurance policy” to ensure learning takes place in every [[Sprint]]. It exposes the gaps in the team’s understanding of a) the problem they’re solving, b) who they’re solving it for and c) why they believe their solutions will work.

>It’s a first step in the shift of the conversation from outputs to outcomes.

## Anatomía
**Box 1 – Business problem statement**  
_What’s changed:_ Better and more detailed instructions along with some hints about what specifically should go in this box.  
_Why it changed:_ There wasn’t enough clarity around what exactly a good business problem is and how it should be worded. This box is designed to help the team articulate what’s changed in the world that has impacted their business in a way that needs to be solved.

e.g., Connectivity is now a commodity. As an organisation that once was a one-stop-shop for connectivity and content we’re now viewed as a “dumb pipe.” How might we might increase the value of our service beyond this perception and increase lifetime customer value and retention?

**Box 2 – Business outcomes**  
_What’s changed:_ More detail about what a good outcome should be.  
_Why it changed:_ A clearer distinction was needed between this box and Box 4. Also, this is an attempt to be clear that what’s needed in this box is a change in someone’s behaviour — a customer, a user, an employee, an executive, etc.

e.g., 25% increase in customer retention, 35% decrease in support calls about the mobile app

**Box 3 – Users**  
_What’s changed:_ A simplification and clarification was added that this is where we’re we add persons and that they should focus not just on customers or users but admins and buyers among other users.  
_Why it changed:_ Having had several canvases sent to me (and seeing them in action with the teams I work with) I noticed that teams were taking a bit of a shortcut with this box. While there are certainly user characteristics everyone believes, it’s important to ensure the team is aligned around a shared vision of the customer.

e.g., Rochelle the IT Administrator who needs to install the system easily and configure hundreds of users at a time on a quarterly basis

**Box 4 – User outcomes and benefits**  
_What’s changed:_ The name of the box has been updated to include benefits and the explanatory text does a more thorough job of explaining what should go in here and why this is an important, unique part of the canvas.  
_Why it changed:_ This has been the part of the canvas with the most confusion. The original goal here was to call these “outcomes” out as emotional goals but the language got confusing. I’ve had many questions over the years about how this differs from Box 2. With this update the difference has been made more distinct. This is a conversation about goals, benefits and emotions. Occasionally we may use metrics here but ideally this is a conversation about empathy.

e.g., Rochelle spends less time configuring users and more time optimising the system for her company’s specific needs

**Box 5 – Solutions**  
_What’s changed:_ Again, better instructional text and hints.  
_Why it changed:_ Depending on the team using the canvas, the items created for this box can vary greatly in scope. This change was designed to help teams see that this box provides the opportunity to offer up solutions big, small, innovative and perhaps a bit “weird.” The goal was to help enhance the brainstorm for this box to include not just tactical features, but new systems or business models as well as non-technical solutions.

**Box 6 – Hypotheses**  
_What’s changed:_ No significant change here.  
_Why it changed:_ It didn’t because it was good enough the first time. 🙂

e.g., We believe a 25% reduction in administration costs will be achieved if Rochelle the System Admin spends less time configuring users with a batch configuration tool.

**Box 7 – What’s the most important thing we need to learn first?**  
_What’s changed:_ Better instructional text to help the user through the two-step process necessary to completing this box successfully.  
_Why it changed:_ When discussing risks with a cross-functional team every discipline, if not every person, on the team will provide their perspective. And they’ll be right. The exercise behind this box is designed to get all those risks out on the table and then choose the riskiest one for the team _right now_. The hint was added to point out that if you’re in the early stages of a hypothesis, value should be the main focus, not feasibility in most cases.

e.g., Does it make sense to add 100 users at a time into our system?

**Box 8 – What’s the least amount of work to learn the next most important thing?**  
_What’s changed:_ No significant change here.  
_Why it changed:_ It didn’t but that’s because experiment design is tricky and can’t really be boiled down into a box on a canvas other than to remind you that it needs to be done as the next step in this process.

e.g., Interview 10 admins that match Rochelle’s profile to understand how they add users today.
